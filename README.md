This jupyter notebook can be used to generate true LHC aperture, which is written and into the Aperture.h5 file for later use.

The notebook also contains some basic example on how to access and plot the aperture. 

Note that the plotting functions rely on another python module (PlotLyPlottingmod) available at
TMsangohan/PlotLyPlotting
